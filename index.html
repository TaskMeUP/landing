                    <p>
                        Today's world is suffering from an information overflow. Its biggest strength is its own weakness and is easy to get trapped when working on your day to day work while keeping up to date with the latest trends and learning that new technology you have just heard about.
                        With this context, is usual to have some sort of to-do lists or read it later app that just gets filled with a lot of stuff that seemed really important when you write them down but then never get attention anymore, <strong>our attention has become our most valuable yet most fragile resource</strong>.
                        TaskMeUp helps you keep track with all of that without polluting your attention. You'll see your last five items created that require immediate action. Those items you don't interact with for a month, will get automatically hidden unless you look specifically for them.
                        This way, you will always have in mind what's important without you having to do the cleanup yourself and helping you to not be overwhelmed with today's information overflow.
